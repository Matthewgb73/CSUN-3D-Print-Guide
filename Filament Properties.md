# Filament Properties

The goal of this document is to explain the different types of filaments and the requirements needed to print said filament. Each filament is unique and requires different settings to accomplish a good print.
When a new brand is bought for printing, Tests should be done to determing the exact properties needed to print well.
# PLA

Polylactic Acid (PLA) is the easiest material to use when first starting off 3D printing. PLA is great for making detailed models and prototypes. 
The filament does not warp which is great for making good, low cost models. 
## Important Information to Remember:
1. Can be printed fast with low temperatures
2. Does not resist high temperatures 
3. Does not do well outdoors and deforms at temperatures over 60℃ 
4. Best use for prototypes or concept ideas

## Properties
  1. Nozzle Temperature: 200-220℃ 
  2. Bed Temperature: 60℃ 
  3. Print Beds: No exceptions
  4. Dry box: Not Needed
  5. Enclosure: Not Needed 
## Brands (these values are determined based on printer and its settings)
