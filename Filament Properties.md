# Filament Properties

The goal of this document is to explain the different types of filaments and the requirements needed to print said filament. Each filament is unique and requires different settings to accomplish a good print.
When a new brand is bought for printing, Tests should be done to determing the exact properties needed to print well.
# PLA

<details>
<Summary>Polylactic Acid (PLA)</summary> is the easiest material to use when first starting off 3D printing. PLA is great for making detailed models and prototypes. 
The filament does not warp which is great for making good, low cost models. 
## Important Information to Remember:
1. Can be printed fast with low temperatures
2. Does not resist high temperatures 
3. Does not do well outdoors and deforms at temperatures over 60℃ 
4. Best use for prototypes or concept ideas

## Properties
  1. Nozzle Temperature: 200-220℃ 
  2. Bed Temperature: 60℃ 
  3. Print Beds: No exceptions
  4. Dry box: Not Needed
  5. Enclosure: Not Needed 
## Brands (these values are determined based on printer and its settings)

# PETG
<details>
  <summary> Polyethylene Terephthalate Modified with Glycol) </summary>
  PETG is the second material commonly used by beginners. It has a stronger material properties that make it great for making parts like holders, clamps and mechanical parts. The material can be hard to print on most printers like the creality ender 3s.
  ## Important Information to Remember:
1. Does not shrink or warp
2. High Tenacity and Flexibility

## Properties
  1. Nozzle Temperature: 230 - 270℃ 
  2. Bed Temperature: 70-90℃ 
  3. Print Beds: Textured Pei
  4. Dry box: Not Needed
  5. Enclosure: Not Needed

# ASA
<details>
  <summary> Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile </summary>
  ASA is improved material to the alternative, ABS. The material is UV light and temperature resistant. It can be disolved in acetone. The material should not be printed on a stock creality printer since its recommended bed temps is 260℃. Can be smoothened with acetone vapor

## Properties
  1. Nozzle Temperature: 260 - 265℃
  2. Bed Temperature: 95 - 110℃
  3. Print Beds: Textured Pei, use gluestick, Prusa has Satin Spring Steel Sheets which is good for ASA
  4. Dry box: Not Needed
  5. Enclosure: yes since material likes to warp 
## Brands (these values are determined based on printer and its settings)
