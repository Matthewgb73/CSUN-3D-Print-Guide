# CSUN - 3DPrint Guide 2022-2023 V1

## Purpose Of Guide

This guide is a comprehensive guide to assist CSUN students to be able to set up their slicing software, optimize their solidworks part files for 3d printing, and to understand the mistakes that occur while 3D printing. 

## Introduction
3D printing is a fun hobby that allows students to grow their skills and allows for creation of useful and fun 3D prints. The myth about 3d printing is that it is a hard hobby to get into. The only difficult part that comes to 3D printing is when you are first starting out and you dont know why the machine is not printing the part properly. The purpose of why I am writing this guide is to show students that they can 3D print as well. I will make sure to answer as much questions as I can and provide all the knowledge I learned so students can become experts as well.
