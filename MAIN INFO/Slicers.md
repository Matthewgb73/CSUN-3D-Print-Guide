# SLICERS
There are many slicers out there and my goal for this section is how to manage each of the FREE slicers out there and to inform you on what you can do with each. 

## [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
To begin, the slicer that I am most familiar with is Cura. This section is being written when Ultimake Cura 5.0.0 is out so information will need to be update if anything new changes.

The image above is what my cura looks like. It will look very different when you first install cura but my goal is to help set up cura to help you print. 

## Things to Change and Things to Know:
First, head to settings and then select **"Configure Setting Visibility"**, we will change some small things to help. 

1. General

* Starting with **General**. Change the currency from euros to dollars. Also, set the theme to "Ultimaker Dark" so that dark mode is applied and it rests your eyes. 

2. Settings

* In the settings tab, change the setting visibility from "Basic" to "All". By doing this, you can see all the features that cura offers. It may look intimidating but later on in this section we will add tools to help give more explanation on what each feature does. 

3. Printers

* In printers, you can add different profiles for different printers. Make sure you select the correct settings for each printer. In the image you can see I have two printers. I renamed them for fun but AVA is my ender 3 pro while Cherry is my Ender 3 v2. Its fun when you make the printer more personalized. If you have octoprint, you can connect to octoprint in the printer settings. 

## Things to Install

The marketplace in Cura is one of the features I enjoy. Here is a list of the plugins I recommend:
* Settings Guide: A full in-depth guide on what the settings do and how to use each of them.
* Automatic Slicing Toggle: adds a button to the sidebar to toggle automatic slicing. It helps to automatically slice the part when changes are made. Saves time from having to press the button every time a change in settings is made.
* Calibration Shapes: I like this setting since it includes a menu of basic shapes, standard tests, and calibration parts like a 20mm xyz cube. 
* Startup Optimiser: It is a great plugin that optomises the startup time when opening Cura.
* ThingiBrowser: allows you to search and import 3D files from places like ThingiVerse or MyMiniFactory directly into Cura. 

These are just a few of the plugins I recommend but look at more plugins and see what is best for you. 

Here is an example of what settings guide does and how it can benefit you.
