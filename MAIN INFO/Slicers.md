# SLICERS
There are many slicers out there and my goal for this section is how to manage each of the FREE slicers out there and to inform you on what you can do with each. 

## [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)
To begin, the slicer that I am most familiar with is Cura. This section is being written when Ultimake Cura 5.0.0 is out so information will need to be update if anything new changes.

The image above is what my cura looks like. It will look very different when you first install cura but my goal is to help set up cura to help you print. 

## Things to change:
First, head to settings and then select **"Configure Setting Visibility"**, we will change some small things to help. 

1. General

* Starting with **General**. Change the currency from euros to dollars. Also, set the theme to "Ultimaker Dark" so that dark mode is applied and it rests your eyes. 

2. Settings

* In the settings tab, change the setting visibility from "Basic" to "All". By doing this, you can see all the features that cura offers. It may look intimidating but later on in this section we will add tools to help give more explanation on what each feature does. 

3. Printers
