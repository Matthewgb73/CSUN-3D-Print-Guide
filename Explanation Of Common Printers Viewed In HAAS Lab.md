### How to set up Cura for Ender 3 V2. 
 1. After installing the latest version of Cura, you will need to set up the printer profile. Click on "Add a non-networked printer" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165186315-186b4310-5606-48aa-a257-500b6c57b7e2.png)
 2. Scroll till you see the brand "Creality3D" and select the "Creality Ender-3 Pro option."I recommend renaming the printer name to "Ender 3 V2." Click "Add" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165186586-e6b8e679-3a15-4363-89db-20cd4ab0d555.png) 
 3. The machine settings window should show up. I usualy change the printer settings to X(Width) and Y(Depth) to 235mm. If you are just starting out, I recommend not changing anything. Click "Next" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165187107-2f906212-bfe3-412a-8241-4b6601b0e69d.png)
 4. You are done! Now STL files can be sliced and printed ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165187184-7500f1ff-f588-46c9-b3ec-7618e5450c4f.png)

 3. Click "Add" 
 4. You are done! Now STL files can be sliced and printed ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165187184-7500f1ff-f588-46c9-b3ec-7618e5450c4f.png)

 PrusaSlicer might be a better if you are more comfortable with it. I personally use cura and havent ran into a problem. 
 
 ## Raise3D Pro 2 Plus

  Note: This printer is one of the most stubborn printers. You have to really know what to do to mess with printer. The slicer it uses is annoying but it can be very beneficial when printing large parts. 
  ### Specifications (STOCK): 
  * Printable Area: 305x305x605mm 
  * Layer Heights 0.01mm layer height
  * Nozzlez: 0.4mm (left) and 0.8mm (right) (Do confirm which nozzle is being used for slicer settings)
  * Printable Materials: Wide range of thermoplastics, including PLA, PETG, ASA, ABS, PC (Polycarbonate), CPE, PVA/BVOH, PVB, HIPS, PP (Polypropylene), Flex, nGen, Nylon, Carbon filled, Woodfill and other filled materials.
  * Slicer: [Ideamaker](https://www.raise3d.com/ideamaker/) (DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH CURA OR OTHER SLICERS!!!)
  * Max Nozzle Temperature: 300℃
  * Max Bed Temperature: 110℃
