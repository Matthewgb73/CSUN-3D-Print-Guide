### How to set up Cura for Ender 3 V2. 
 1. After installing the latest version of Cura, you will need to set up the printer profile. Click on "Add a non-networked printer" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165186315-186b4310-5606-48aa-a257-500b6c57b7e2.png)
 2. Scroll till you see the brand "Creality3D" and select the "Creality Ender-3 Pro option."I recommend renaming the printer name to "Ender 3 V2." Click "Add" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165186586-e6b8e679-3a15-4363-89db-20cd4ab0d555.png) 
 3. The machine settings window should show up. I usualy change the printer settings to X(Width) and Y(Depth) to 235mm. If you are just starting out, I recommend not changing anything. Click "Next" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165187107-2f906212-bfe3-412a-8241-4b6601b0e69d.png)
