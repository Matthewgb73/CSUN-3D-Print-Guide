# How to Make Solidwork Parts Into Printable Files

Most 3D printing slicing software accept 3 common types of filetypes:
  1. STL
  2. OBJ
  3. 3MF
  
I personally recommend using the STL it is the more popularly use filetype on opensource slicers. 

## Solidworks to STL

We will look at this part and how to make it printable 
1. you want to save your file as an STL ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165600632-f240acc8-99ef-4758-9d50-f21ed2a6a9e7.png)
2. change the file as an STL![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165601204-f93c1270-628f-4f5c-8913-1ac1ef7548cf.png)
3. To be extra secure, press options and make sure your resolution is fine or make it finer if needed. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165648466-91e3846d-4bb1-4986-a731-f02af9eb1e8c.png)
4. After, close window, click save and then open CURA or Preferred Slicer.
5. On Cura, there is a folder on the top left that lets the user import their STL file into the slicer. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165648835-b85bf13d-d99e-4ee3-aeec-2bebef48a7d8.png)
6. If the part shows up like this, use the rotate tool to move the part so its flat on the bed. 3D printers are not good at printing overhangs and printing in this orientation uses more material and supports. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80706125/165649045-2481dc38-0bed-4f23-acaf-d671d4da5e16.png)
